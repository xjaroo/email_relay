# ðŸ“  Secure SMTP Email Forwarder for Scanned Documents

This is a lightweight, self-hosted SMTP relay server written in Python using `aiosmtpd`. It is designed to receive scanned documents from a multifunction printer (MFP), and securely forward them to intended recipients via the [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) email API.
